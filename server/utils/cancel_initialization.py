"""
Initialization Cancellation Module
===================================

Handles complete cleanup when initialization is cancelled, ensuring
the project can be cleanly re-initialized from session 0.

This fixes the issue where cancelled initializations leave behind:
- Session records in the database
- Log files in the project directory
- Incorrect session numbering for the next initialization
