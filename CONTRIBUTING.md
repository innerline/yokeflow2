2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yokeflow.git
   cd yokeflow
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ms4inc/yokeflow.git
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

Follow the setup instructions in [README.md](README.md) to get YokeFlow running locally:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ (for web UI and MCP server)
- Python 3.9+ (for core platform)
- Docker (for PostgreSQL and sandboxing)
- Claude API token

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install web UI dependencies
cd web-ui
npm install
cd ..

# Build MCP task manager
cd mcp-task-manager
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize database
python scripts/init_database.py --docker

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Claude API token
```

## Project Background

YokeFlow evolved from [Anthropic's Autonomous Coding demo](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-quickstarts/tree/main/autonomous-coding), transforming it into an API-first platform with comprehensive features including:
- TypeScript/React Web UI with real-time monitoring
- REST API with 17+ endpoints
- PostgreSQL database with async operations
- Docker sandbox support for secure execution
- Automated verification system with test generation
- Production hardening (retry logic, checkpointing, intervention)

While we've made significant improvements, there are still exciting opportunities to enhance the platform further.

## Areas for Contribution

### 1. Core Enhancements

**High-Impact Areas:**
- **Brownfield Support** - Extend YokeFlow to modify existing codebases (not just greenfield)
- **Non-UI Applications** - Support for CLIs, APIs, libraries, and backend services
- **Selective Browser Testing** - Limit browser verification to UI-related tasks only
- **Authentication System** - Implement the planned per-user authentication (see TODO-FUTURE.md)

### 2. Integration & Connectivity

**Expand YokeFlow's ecosystem:**
- **GitHub Integration** - Automatic repository creation, PR management, issue tracking
- **Task Manager Integration** - Connect with Jira, Linear, GitHub Projects, etc.
- **Spec Writer Companion** - AI-powered specification writing tool
- **CI/CD Integration** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins workflows

### 3. User Interface Improvements

The current UI prioritizes functionality over polish. See [UI-NOTES.md](UI-NOTES.md) for details:
- Enhanced visual design and UX
- Better progress visualization
- Real-time session monitoring improvements
- Mobile responsiveness
- Dark mode support

### 4. Intelligent Agent Behavior

**Make the agent smarter:**
- **Dynamic Model Selection** - Choose coding models based on task complexity
- **Context-Aware Testing** - Smarter test generation based on task type
- **Adaptive Verification** - Skip browser tests for non-UI features
- **Cost Optimization** - Use cheaper models for simple tasks

### 5. Project Management Features

**Enhance project control:**
- **Epic/Task/Test Editing** - Allow manual editing before coding sessions begin
- **Final Project Review** - Comprehensive comparison between created app and specs
- **Mid-Project Adjustments** - Support for spec changes during development
- **Task Dependencies** - Better handling of task ordering and dependencies

### 6. Prompt Engineering

**For less technical contributors:**
- Experiment with initialization prompts for better task generation
- Optimize coding prompts for specific project types (e-commerce, SaaS, dashboards)
- Test various project specifications to identify best practices
- Document what types of specs work best with YokeFlow
- Improve error recovery prompts

### 7. Platform Compatibility

**Broaden platform support:**
- Windows environment testing and adjustments
- Linux distribution testing
- E2B sandbox integration (alternative to Docker)
- Cloud deployment configurations (AWS, GCP, Azure)

### 8. Performance & Scalability

**Make YokeFlow faster and more efficient:**
- Database query optimization
- Parallel task execution
- Caching strategies
- Memory usage optimization
- Session resumption improvements

## Current Limitations & Known Issues

Understanding current limitations helps identify contribution opportunities:

### Core Limitations
1. **Greenfield Projects Only** - Currently limited to creating new projects from scratch
2. **Web Application Focus** - Primarily designed for UI-based web applications
3. **Universal Browser Verification** - Verifies every feature with browser automation

### Platform Compatibility
- Developed and tested primarily on macOS
- May require adjustments for Windows environments
- Docker support helps with cross-platform consistency

### Known Gaps (see YOKEFLOW_REFACTORING_PLAN.md)
- Authentication not yet implemented (2 tests deferred)
- Some integration tests require database setup
- Documentation could always be improved

### PR Requirements

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Follows coding standards
- ✅ Commit messages are clear
- ✅ PR description is complete

## Coding Standards

### Python

- **Follow PEP 8** style guide
- **Use type hints** for function signatures
- **Write docstrings** for modules, classes, and functions
- **Keep functions focused** (single responsibility)
- **Use async/await** for database operations

Example:
```python
async def get_project_status(project_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get the current status of a project.

    Args:
        project_id: UUID of the project

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing project status information

    Raises:
        ValueError: If project_id is invalid
        DatabaseError: If database query fails
    """
    # Implementation
```

### TypeScript/React

- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Follow React best practices** (hooks, functional components)
- **Use proper types** (avoid `any`)
- **Components should be focused** and reusable
- **Use Tailwind CSS** for styling

Example:
```typescript
interface ProjectStatusProps {
  projectId: string;
  onUpdate?: (status: ProjectStatus) => void;
}

export function ProjectStatus({ projectId, onUpdate }: ProjectStatusProps) {
  // Implementation
}
```
