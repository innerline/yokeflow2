**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 2025
**Project Type:** Full-stack SaaS Application

## Overview

Build a modern task management SaaS application with real-time collaboration, team workspaces, and comprehensive project tracking capabilities.

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- Email/password authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Member)
- OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
- Session management and refresh tokens
- **Implementation details**: See `api-design.md#authentication`
- **Code example**: See `example-auth.py` for reference implementation pattern

### 2. Workspace Management
- Multi-tenant workspace architecture
- Workspace creation and invitation system
- Team member management
- Workspace settings and customization
- **Database schema**: See `database-schema.md#workspaces`

### 3. Project & Task Management
- Hierarchical structure: Workspaces → Projects → Tasks
- Task creation, assignment, and tracking
- Priority levels and due dates
- Status workflows (Todo, In Progress, Review, Done)
- Labels and custom fields
- **API endpoints**: See `api-design.md#projects-tasks`

### 4. Real-time Collaboration
- WebSocket-based live updates
- Real-time task updates across users
- Presence indicators (who's online)
- Activity feed
- **Technical implementation**: See `technical-architecture.md#websockets`

### 5. Comments & Attachments
- Task comments with mentions (@user)
- File attachments (images, documents)
- Comment threading
- **Storage architecture**: See `technical-architecture.md#file-storage`

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation (Epics 1-5)
1. Project setup and infrastructure
2. Database schema and migrations
3. Authentication system
4. Basic API structure
5. Frontend foundation

### Phase 2: Core Features (Epics 6-12)
6. Workspace management
7. Project CRUD operations
8. Task management
9. Real-time updates
10. Comments system
11. File attachments
12. User interface components

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Epics 13-18)
13. Search and filtering
14. Activity feed
15. Notifications
16. User preferences
17. Workspace analytics
18. Polish and optimization

## Key Requirements

### Functional
- ✅ Users can create multiple workspaces
- ✅ Real-time collaboration across team members
- ✅ Comprehensive task management features
- ✅ Secure authentication and authorization
- ✅ File upload and storage
- ✅ Search and filtering capabilities

### Non-Functional
